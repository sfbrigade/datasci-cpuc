At the moment, we have just started this project.  If there's something you want to help out with, here's how to get started:  

[Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), then clone your repo locally
```
$ git clone <your-repo>
$ cd <this-repo's-name>
$ git remote add upstream <this-repo>
```
Launch a local server.  If you're on a Mac, you already have [SimpleHTTPServer](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules-in-python/how-to-use-simplehttpserver/) installed:  
```
$ cd path/to/local/clone
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

You could also use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) if you wanted  
Create a feature branch:
```
$ git checkout -b <feature-branch>
```
Do some work:  
```
$ vim <some-files>
```
When you're ready, commit, [merge any upstream changes](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/), [deal with conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/), and push your branch ([aka, forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow))   
```
$ git commit -am 'my awesome feature'
$ git pull upstream master
  # solve conflicts
$ git push
```
[Create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) from your pushed branch (compare branch) to this repo (base branch)   
...  
Profit!
